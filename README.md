# Kaggle Titanic
This is my reperesentation for the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster.

### Goal for this Notebook:
I want to show an example of an analysis of the Titanic disaster in Python using Data Science utilities. 

#### In This Notebook I'm practicing skills of:
#### Data Handling
*   Importing Data with Pandas
*   Cleaning Data
*   Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

#### Data Analysis
I will try to use different machine learning algorithms to get the best result
*    Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
    *   Logistic Regression Model
    *   K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
    *   Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    *   Naive Bayess algorithm
    *   Decision Tree
    *   Random Forest

#### Valuation of the Analysis
*   K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
*   Output the results from the IPython Notebook to Kaggle
