# Kaggle Titanic
This is my reperesentation for the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster.

### Goal for this Notebook:
I want to show an example of an analysis of the Titanic disaster in Python using Data Science utilities. 

#### In This Notebook i practicing skills of:
#### Data Handling
*   Importing Data with Pandas
*   Cleaning Data
*   Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

#### Data Analysis
*    Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
    +   Logit Regression Model
    +   Plotting results
    +   Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels
    +   Basic Random Forest
    +   Plotting results

#### Valuation of the Analysis
*   K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
*   Output the results from the IPython Notebook to Kaggle


### Benchmark Scripts
To find the basic scripts for the competition benchmarks look in the "Python Examples" folder. These scripts are based on the originals provided by Astro Dave but have been reworked so that they are easier to understand for new comers.
